1. Introduction **(5 min)**
    a. define "technology" (not just computers!)
    b. some relevant use cases
        i. decisionmaking
        ii. document sharing and editing
        iii. bookkeeping
2.  Discussion **(10-15 min)**
    a. "What technologies does your co-op use for decisionmaking,
    document sharing, and bookkeeping? When do these work well, and when do they
    fail? Remember, technologies include things like rules for running meetings,
    written notes, signs, as well as computerized technologies."
    b. This can be either a whole-group or breakout-into-small-groups discussion
    c. Separate discussion for each use case (decisionmaking, document sharing,
    bookkeeping)
3.  Overview of relevant software **(15 min)**
    a. parallels between "free and open source" and cooperative communities
    b. decentralized technology: "consensus between computers"
    c. advantages for autonomy and robustness
    d. examples
        a. Google docs (best practices)
            i.  who "owns" the documents?
            ii. local backups
        b. wikis, git and version control
        c. Loomio and Platform Co-ops
        e. Open ledgers and decentralized currencies
3.  Discussion **(rest of time)**
    a. Share visions of the future - "what do we want computers to do for us?"
    a. "What are obstacles to changing technologies? Which of these obstacles
    are actionable?"
4.  Wrap up, contact sharing
    a. will make voluntary mailing list for continuing the discussion, sharing
    new projects, finding collaborators, etc
    
More discussion questions, which we may or may not have time for:

-   Are there "use cases" I am missing? What repetitive, automatable tasks do you
    have to do that could be done by a computer instead?
-   Automation vs. augmentation: what are the impacts of automating labor? What
    role should co-ops play?
-   Longer discussion on cryptocurrencies, smart contracts
-   How to find/make allies in tech, and how to recognize and avoid toxic tech
    culture
