Coding Movement in Sign Languages: the Typannot Approach
====

> - Goal is to facilitate transcription of observed movement, for linguistic
    study of sign languages
> - Five criteria: readability, writability, searchability, genericity,
    modularity

Parameterization of Hand Shapes
=================

Parameterization of Hand Shapes
==================================

> - allows for several million possible hand shapes
> - about 500 commonly used shapes in practice
> - but sign language also includes arm, eye, and mouth movements

Parameterization of Arm Positions
======

> - *intrinsic* frame of reference (centered on body part) vs. *extrinsic* (relative to rest of body)
> - discretized degrees of freedom: flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, internal/external rotation


Levels of Abstraction
==========

User Interface
=============

> - Multiple interfaces edit the same backend description
> - generic low-level UI, module UI, gestural UI (using LeapMotion and IMU)

Challenges
========

> - Segmenting the preparation for a sign from the sign itself
> - Takes up to five hours to transcribe a single minute of sign
