> -   **Bouncing robots:** discovering (and proving) dynamical properties of simple robot motion models
>     -   find minimal control and hardware that gives desired properties: periodic motion or
>         other attractors, coverage

> -   **Improv:** high-level language for control of mobile robots
>     -   small domain-specific language, compiles to ROS
>     -   Future work: type-level checks and/or explicit model checking (with
>         DryVR?)?
> -   **Aggregate robot systems:** dynamics of local interactions toward minimal control
> -   **Automatic robot design** and automation of Robot Design Game


General Approach to Robot Decisionmaking
================================

> - focus on information spaces: space of all histories of sensor readings and actions
    taken
> - can reduce to different space (ex: only keep track of one bit: robot on wall,
    or not on wall)
> - can encode dynamical information explicity (equations) or implicitly (if robot goes
    forward forever, it will hit something)
> - can create filters, planners over information spaces (good for when we don't
    know, or don't need to know, physical state space)
> - **task specific** design: how to specify tasks?


Mobile Robots
=============

> - many mobile robot tasks are actually properties of the path the robot takes
    through space
    - coverage, environmental monitoring, patrolling, navigation
> - many simple models of mobile robot motion
> - which ones have nice dynamical properties that we can get "for free"
    (without a lot of feedback control)?


Blind, Bouncing Robots
======================

Model the robot as a point moving **in straight lines** in the plane, "bouncing" off the boundary
at a **fixed angle** $\theta$ from the normal:


![A point robot moving in the plane. The top row shows bounces at zero degrees
from the normal. The second row shows bounces at 50 degrees clockwise from
normal. The third row shows the same angle but with a "monotonicity" property
enforced.](../figures/bounce_examples_w_monotone.pdf)


Trapping or Coverage Properties
===============================


![In this environment, bouncing at the normal, the robot will become trapped
in the area between the purple lines.](../figures/triangle_trap.jpg)


Implementation
==============


> - Assume we know environment exactly
> - Can implement on a roomba with bump sensor and IR prox detector [^2]
> - "Collisions" can be virtual - for example, robot w/ camera stops when it is collinear
    with two landmarks, and rotates until one landmark is at a certain heading
> - Also useful model of very small "robots" or microorganisms [^5], or robots in
    low-bandwith environments

Goals
=====


> - confirm on-paper results and inspire new proofs
> - minimize simulation / discretization / floating point artifacts
> - synthesize controllers (bounce angles + some transition condition, depending
on sensors)

584 Project - Reachability in 2D with SpaceEx
=============================================


\centering code generation for given polygon and bounce angle


\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',auto,node distance=2.5cm,
  thick,main node/.style={circle,draw,minimum size = 1.7cm, font=\scriptsize}]
\node[main node] (x0)   [align=center] {$\dot{x} = v_x$\\$\dot{y} =v_y$};

\path[]
    (x0) edge [loop above,thick] node {$e_1$} (x0)
    (x0) edge [loop right,thick] node {$e_2$} (x0)
    (x0) edge [loop left,thick] node {$e_3$} (x0)
    (x0) edge [loop below,thick] node {$e_4$} (x0);

\end{tikzpicture}


Results of Simulations 
=======================



When bouncing between parallel sides, SpaceEx finds fixed point within a few
iterations!

This type of bouncing is geometrically exact: $f_{1,3}(f_{3,1}(x)) = x$ if
$f_{i,j}$ is the
mapping from side $e_i$ to side $e_j$.

Results of Simulations - Nonconvergence w/ Asymptotic Stability
===============================================================


When periodic orbit is asymptotically stable, SpaceEx does not appear to
converge, even when trajectories should (mathematically) always return to same interval

. . .


How to encode "contraction" property, or automatically detect?

The Synthesis Problem
=====================

> - Use this as subroutine for synthesis algorithms: given environment, what bounce angles produce
    paths with certain properties (coverage, limit cycles)?
>   - Stability detection with reachability (if robot starts in interval on
      edge $i$, show it will not reach the complement of that interval)
> - Modelling / synthesizing strategies over multiple angles (generate multiple
>   automata and compose)


Results
=======

> - For synthesis: is exponential blow-up going to be a problem?

Future Work
===========

> - Clean up codebase
> - Add support for bounce angle nondeterminsm
> - Keep developing mathematical theory
> - Incorporate minimal feedback control (what if we have a pebble, colored
>   walls, laser beams, etc) and information space representation
> - balance between small modelling distance (1D) and generality for other motion
>   primitives (2D)

Improv
======

Project from Dr. Amy LaViers' 598 in Spring 2017 (Movement Representation and
High-Level Robotic Control), collaborated with Chase Gladish

. . .

"Live coding" high-level language for mobile robots using ROS

. . .

(show video)


Architecture Overview
=====================


![](../figures/flowchart.pdf)\


Workflow
========

My current workflow:

> -   launch ROS and simulator
> -   edit ROS node, change motion sequence / controller
> -   reset simulator, relaunch ROS node
    -   can script using rosservice, launch files

. . .

What is live-coding?

> -   Usually has a performance/improvisational connotation
> -   requires low latency / flow


Problem $\iff$ Program
======================


```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    pub = rospy.Publisher('turtle1/cmd_vel',Twist)
    rospy.init_node('publisher_node')
    loop_rate = rospy.Rate(5)
    while not rospy.is_shutdown():
        vel=Twist()
        vel.linear.x = 1.0
        vel.angular.z = 1.0
        pub.publish(vel)
        loop_rate.sleep()
```

Two Issues in Creating Robotic Motion
=====================================


### Live coding (with a motion DSL) addresses

1.  confusing workflow for beginners
    -   large number of steps required
    -   order of steps unclear
    -   hard to install programs
1.  bad mapping between problem domain and program domain
    -   have to "translate" our representation of task into software semantics

. . .

Formal methods and verification can help with step 2, as well as help provide
informative feedback when something goes wrong.


Using roshask [^1]
=================================


- Haskell client library for ROS
- interpret DSL to a Haskell ADT representing a movement pattern
- convert to ROS message


```haskell
mkTwist :: VelCmd Double -> Twist
mkTwist (VelCmd t r) = def  & angular . V.z .~ r
                            & linear . V.x .~ t
                            
```
[^1]: [@cowley2011stream]


The Modelling Problem
=====================

How to model motion in a way that is amenable to a simple, high-level DSL?


A Detour into Monoids
=====================


A *monoid* is a set $S$ along with a binary operation $\diamond :: S \to S \to
S$ and a distinguished element $\epsilon :: S$, subject to:

$$ \epsilon \diamond x = x \diamond \epsilon = x $$

\vspace{-2em}

$$ x \diamond (y \diamond z) = (x \diamond y) \diamond z $$

for all $x,y,z \in S$.

### Why think about monoids? [@monoids]

-   Simple algebraic model of composition
-   Can show common structures, build up abstraction quickly

Monoids
=======


![Composing a list of *Diagrams* primitives [@monoids]](../figures/diagrams.jpg)


Data Structures - Space
=======================

```haskell
data Dance b = Prim Action Mult b
             | Rest Mult
             | Skip -- id for series, parallel
             | Dance b :+: Dance b -- in series
             | Dance b :||: Dance b -- in parallel
        deriving (Show, Eq, Read)
```
. . .

```haskell
-- map over parts (for changing platforms)
instance Functor Dance where
    fmap f (x :+: y) = (fmap f x) :+: (fmap f y)
    fmap f (x :||: y) = (fmap f x) :||: (fmap f y)
    fmap f (Rest m) = Rest m
    fmap f (Skip) = Skip
    fmap f (Prim act m part) = Prim act m (f part)
```

Robot-Specific Specification
============================



```haskell
robotRes = 100 :: Mult -- messages/second, ROS publishing rate
robotRate = 1 :: Mult -- seconds per "beat"
```

. . .


```haskell
data Action = A Direction Extent

moveBase :: Action -> VelCmd Double
moveBase (A Center _)        = VelCmd 0 0 -- no articulation
moveBase (A _ Zero)          = VelCmd 0 0 -- no movement
moveBase (A Lef Quarter)     = VelCmd 0 (pi/2) -- rad/sec
moveBase (A Forward Quarter) = VelCmd 0.1 0 -- meters/sec

```
. . .

> - For round differential drive robot, rest of `moveBase` functions can be derived from these primitives!
> - Inspired by choreography and by *Dance* [@Dance2003]

Domain-Specific Language
===========

```haskell
x = [forward forward]
y = forward || right
r1 $ repeat (x y)
```

> -   top level is a free monoid (list)
> -   sequential composition (in brackets) causes all movements to happen in one
    "beat"
> -   parallel composition is collapsed to vector averages
> -   can define symmetries over directions and body parts
> -   `repeat`, `reflect`, `reverse`, `retrograde`



Opportunities for Formal Methods
================================


> -   would be nice to have model checking like that provided by *Koord*
> -   will robots collide? above a certain speed? are you asking for
      unexecutable motion (ie: move arm when it's already in extremal position)?
> -   need Haskell for ROS interfacing - unless someone models ROS client in
      K with code generation...
> -   some verification can be done at type level in Haskell; Haskell also has some
      verification/proof libraries
> -   could model Improv DSL in K and have some model of what the simulator
      is doing (DryVR). How modular is Koord / K / DryVR implementation?
