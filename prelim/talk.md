New Frontiers in Robotics
--------------------

![](images/weird_robots.png){height="300px" class="center"}


New Technologies, New Priorities
--------------------------------

> - New materials make rigid-body, collision-avoidance approaches less necessary.
> - More remote and extreme environments (including very small scales) require
new hardware and software approaches.
>   - Need more robustness to uncertainty in sensing, actuation
>   - Simple, even purely reactive strategies can be easier to implement and get guarantees on behavior

Important Concepts
----------------

> - *preimage*: set of states that reach a goal under a given action
> - *funnel*: outer bound of reachable set for a given trajectory
> - *compliance*: motion designed to handle unknown system constraints. Can be passive (ex: gripper design), or active (ex: force feedback).
> - *conformance*: planning under uncertainty in initial state or actions
> - *belief space planning*: planning over distributions on possible states
> - *information space planning*: planning over derived information states

. . .

How can we leverage boundary interactions to make motion strategies and plans for mobile robots
that can handle intrinsic uncertainty?


Definitions
-----------

> - *contact*: state of physical touching
> - *collision*: contact with implied mechanical interaction (friction, sliding, etc)
> - *boundary interaction*: umbrella term; "what does the robot do when it reaches
a boundary in its environment?"
>   - can be an analytic model (i.e., reflection law)
>   - can be a distribution over trajectories, data-driven
>   - boundaries can be walls, laser beams, GPS boundaries, etc

Results: Bouncing Robots
=======

Modelling Assumptions
---------------------

- Robot position modelled as a *point* in a *polygonal environment* (possibly with polygonal
obstacles).
- Robots move in *straight lines* until they encounter a boundary.


![](images/bounce_examples.jpg){width=700px class="center"}



Modelling Uncertainty
---------------------


![](images/bounce_example_nondet.png){width=400px class="center"}

Uncertainty is unavoidable... Plan over **nondeterministic** bounce rules!

. . .

What kinds of error and nondeterminism does this include?

How to Implement?
-----------------

> - differential drive with bump sensors and side-facing range sensor ("rotate-to-parallel")
> - virtual boundaries (laser beams, GPS, visible boundaries, etc)
> - contact sensor and mechanical alignment of robot body ("rotate-until-free")

. . .

![](images/reorient.gif){width=300px class="center"}


Geometry Influences Dynamics
----------------------------

Given geometry, parameterize points on outer boundary and obstacles.

We can explicitly compute transition function $f$ between points on
the boundary.

![](images/contraction_map_cond.png){width=350px class="center"}\


Geometry Influences Dynamics
----------------------------

$f$ is a *contraction mapping* iff $|\frac{f(x, \theta) - f(y,\theta)}{x-y} | < 1$

. . .

For two mutually visible straight-line segments, this quantity (the *contraction
coefficient*) is independent of $x, y$ and depends only on $\theta$ and the
internal angle $\phi$ between the segments.

. . .

Can be used to reduce uncertainty!


![](images/bounce_images.gif){width=150px class="center"}\



Limit Cycles
------------------

<div class="row">
<div class="column" width="35%">

![](images/cycles.gif){width=250 class="center"}\


</div>
<div class="column" width="65%">

To write down a transition function for an entire cycle, compose individual
transition functions until the composition is a return map.


A cycle is **stable** when this return map is a
*contraction mapping*: two points under the mapping become closer together.


**Proposition:** For all start points on the boundary of all polygons, a constant
fixed-angle controller exists which will cause the robot's trajectory to enter a
stable limit cycle.


</div>
</div>



Results: Nondeterministic Planning
==================


Approach
---------


**Planning Problem:** Given start and goal sets on the boundary of the
polygonal environment, create a sequence of safe
nondeterministic actions that takes the robot from any point in the start set
to some point in the goal set.

> 1. Partition boundary using "visibility events"
> 2. Create *safe edge-to-edge transition graph* using boundary segments
> 3. Search for paths and cycles (depending on specification)
> 4. Translate paths to strategies

Nondeterministic Planning
-------------------------


We know the exact map of the environment at planning time.

. . .

**Bounce rule:** action to take at boundary, convex subset $u \subseteq (0, \pi)$.

. . .

Planner produces sequence of **bounce rules**.

Visibility Decomposition
------------------------

Equivalence relation on points along boundary with respect to what edges of
original polygon they can "see".

![](images/new_partial_local_sequence.png){width=400px class="center"}\


Defining Safe Actions
---------------------

**Safe actions**: Given two edges ($e_{start}$ and $e_{goal}$) in the environment polygon, an interval of
bounce angles is **safe** iff:

. . .

any action in the interval,

. . .

executed from any point on $e_{start}$,

. . .

will cause the robot to transition to some point on $e_{goal}$.


Forming the Safe Bounce Visibility Graph
----------------------------

**Nodes**: Edges of *partitioned* polygon.

**Edges**: Directed. Present if safe action exists between edge $e_i$ and edge
$e_j$. Edge holds data on safe angle interval.

. . .

Algorithm 1 of WAFR 2018 paper: polygon with $n$ vertices will produce bounce visibility
graph with $O(n^2)$ nodes and $O(n^4)$ edges.


Forming the Safe Bounce Visibility Graph
----------------------------


![](images/safe_bvg.png){width=750 class="center"}


Examples of Search Queries
--------------------------

If we want to give our robot a constant control input, can use breadth-first search with constraint
intersection.

![](images/inserted_two_conv.png){width=700px class="center"}\

Examples of Search Queries
--------------------

We can search while bounding the maximum distance travelled by the robot by
labelling each edge with the maximum distance travelled by any transition
represented by that edge.

. . .

Can search for only contracting paths, or keep the total state expansion/contraction under a bounded
amount.

. . .

Of all paths from A to B (up to bounded length), which allows the most unreliable robot?

. . .

In all cases, along with a plan, we also get a characterization of how much uncertainty the
plan can tolerate (design constraints!)

Completeness and Correctness
----------------------------

This is an exact planner, so all found solutions are correct, and it will not
return any infeasible plans.

. . .

However, it is **not** complete, for three reasons:

> - currently does not take into account knowledge about initial conditions
> - does not allow state splitting during the search (robot state is maintained
as one contiguous set of points along the environment boundary)
> - does not take into account how some state transitions reduce uncertainty

Remaining Goals and Approach
============================

Main Goal: "The Bouncing Robot Design Game"
-------------------------------------------


<div class="row">
<div class="column" width="50%">

Combine and extend work so far into an interactive tool for designing bouncing
robot systems.

Space of possible systems designs is large!


I see this as a first step toward a CAD tool for micro-robotic assembly systems.

<div class="column" width="50%">

</div>
</div>

Features of Design Tool
-----------------------

Interface:

> - More visualizations, such as coverage, sample trajectories for plans, 
  trapping regions, etc.
> - Interactive placement of sensors, geometry, gates, etc.
> - "Toolbox" of low-level controllers (ex: bounce rules and initial conditions
needed to create cycle in selected region)
> - User iteratively builds hierarchical controller.

System Sensor Placement
-----------------------

Proposed first sensors:

> - colored "laser beams" that emit a signal when they are crossed by a robot
> - chemical comparators and globally switchable chemical "sources"

. . .

Most useful sensors are ones with computable spatial preimages, because they 
induce a natural environment discretization. Can compare and optimize wrt
planner discretization.


Planning in Information Space
-----------------------------

Given user-defined regions within the environment (target regions), we want to
be able to design *flows*: collective robot movement patterns that achieve a
task.

. . .

For some tasks, like ones that require visiting some regions in a particular order, we can use the
existing planner to automatically compute solutions.

. . .


User and program work together to create controller.


Abstractions on Dynamics
------------------------

Given initial conditions and a controller:

> - visualize and bound persistent states, using contraction properties
> - analyze ergodicity for coverage applications?

. . .

Both of these could be "data-driven" over forward simulations of the nondeterministic
dynamical system. Also plan to continue work on analytical characterizations of
the dynamical systems.

![](images/pent_chaos.png){class="center" width=130px}


Stretch goal
------------

LTL specifications and plan synthesis

. . .

"eventually reach region *A*..."

"stay in region *B* until..."

Conclusion
----------

- "Bouncing robot" model is cool and applies to a wide range of physical
systems!
- Compliance and minimalism are cool principles and still useful!
- Lots of very cool problems to work on, especially when looking at sensor
models / information spaces / low-complexity controllers.
